# Password Generator

## Description

In this project, I have attempted to write the JavaScript language that will generate a unique password depending on a selected number of character and choosing to use at least one of the following character types...Upper case letters, lower case letter, numbers, or special characters, this was a very difficult task.  I had a vague wire frame laid out, I knew I needed to prompt the user for inputs, declare variables, and include different kinds of loops.  Writing functions was the most difficult part of this task but I believe my code has met the requirements.  I look forward to improving my readability, adding more tools to my belt, and writing a more polished code.
